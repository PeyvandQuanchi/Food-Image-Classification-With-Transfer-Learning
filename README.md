# Food-Image-Classification-With-Transfer-Learning
A deep learning project that leverages transfer learning and data augmentation to classify images as either food or non-food. Using the Food-5K dataset, this notebook demonstrates how to build an effective image classification model with minimal training data by fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network.

# Key Features

* Transfer Learning using pre-trained models

* Data Augmentation for improved generalization

* Binary classification: food vs. non-food

* Training metrics and loss visualization

* Organized data pipeline for training and validation sets
